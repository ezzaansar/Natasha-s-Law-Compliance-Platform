## 🎯 Overview

This platform helps small UK food businesses (cafés, bakeries, food trucks) comply with Natasha's Law, which requires pre-packed for direct sale (PPDS) foods to display full ingredient lists with 14 specific allergens clearly labeled.

**Problem:** Manual allergen tracking is error-prone, time-consuming, and can result in £5,000 fines or business closure.

**Solution:** Automated allergen management with deterministic calculation, ensuring 100% accuracy for food safety compliance.
